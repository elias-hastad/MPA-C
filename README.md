# MPA-C
## Marvin the Paranoid Android (Core)


<b>MPA-C is a lightweight framework for prototyping single page web applications with the use of vanilla PHP, Javascript, and CSS. The inspiration for the name comes from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, specifically a character that embodies my frustration for generalised frameworks.</b>
<br>
<br>
MPA-C aims to provide a lighter and more succinct method for rapid development of single page web applications with minimal content that provide a specific task; it is similar to how a microservice may operate independently.


### Components 

Each component has an operation to enable easier prototyping. This is a bespoke framework ideally for data embedded in files and creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for a dashboard. 

This framework uses MVC (Model-View-Controller) to handle a user's interactions with your application. It is purposely built to handle data and display it for a specific user, providing dynamic content. 

<div align="left">

There are several components that interact with each for prototyping - see usage below: 
<br>
<br>


- PHP: MVC handles the data for the application alongside providing useful methods for various CRUD and file handling tasks. 
- CSS: Customised bootstrap with complete colour scheme and templating system for ease of use 
- JS: Methods for animations and AJAX requests

</div>


### Naming

The naming conventions are uniform across the entirety of the project for ease of use. 

Names primarily use acronyms for shortness and ability to amalgamate components into singular objects.
